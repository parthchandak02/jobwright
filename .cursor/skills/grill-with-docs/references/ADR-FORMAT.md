# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc.

Create the `docs/adr/` directory lazily - only when the first ADR is needed and Doc creation in the skill allows it.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why* - not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs will not need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) - useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options** - only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences** - only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** - the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** - a future reader will look at the code and wonder why it was done this way
3. **The result of a real trade-off** - there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it. If it is not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there is nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library - just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only." Explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** Compliance limits, partner API latency budgets, platform restrictions.
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it - otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL again later.
